                   <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in 
            sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name
            Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most
            widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.[2]</p>
     <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a
        crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious. The English name "wart"-hog 
        refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. The males also have very prominent 
        tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller.
        They are largely herbivorous, but, like most suids, opportunistically eat invertebrates or small animals, even 
        scavenging on carrion.</p>

    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
